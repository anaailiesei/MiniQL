# MiniQL
Developed a custom Query Language inspired by SQL, designed to work with a self-built database. The language supports operations on individual tables and interactions between multiple tables. Leveraged extension syntax and implicits to simplify function calls, resulting in an intuitive and elegant query syntax.
